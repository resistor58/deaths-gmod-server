Worst script I ever contributed to, listen servers make checks hard... :|
All this is based on the logic that "Client" is in singleplayer, or is the listen server host, and, from a joiners point of view, the server is the dedicated server or the listenserver host.
Finally, it is also based on the logic that this script is either downloaded from a server, or is present in an autorun directory and is autoran on the client.
When some checks don't seem to make ANY sense, remember the above.
Yeah, now you can see why it was hard. -- Anticept

SOMEHOW, this section of the script ran. This was put here for the freak cases, so you get this:

EASTER EGG from TomyLobo & Anticept.
This part of the script should have NEVER been ran. This means your wiremod install is badly screwed up, by you or a server.
First, try deleting your garrysmod/cache folder. If this doesn't work, go to wiremod.com and view the "Technical Support" section.
Read the "Ultimate guide to problems in GMod" sticky in that section to create a CLEAN Garrys Mod Install.
If this doesn't work, post a condump and Q-Menu screenshot in a new help topic, and don't forget to include the other information
that the "Ultimate guide to problems in GMod" sticky tells you to!
